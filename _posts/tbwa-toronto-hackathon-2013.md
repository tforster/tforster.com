Earlier this year I organized and hosted a highly successful 48 hour company-wide hackathon. It differed significantly from traditional hackathons in that less than 20% of the participants had any significant technical background. The ultimate goal of this hackathon was several-fold and included:
boosting morale
introducing the lean, fast-paced and iterative approach to product delivery found in hackathons and startups
easing people from traditional (i.e. print and broadcast) backgrounds into the digital world
having fun
There were tremendous challenges to meet including convincing our President, Chief Creative Officer and Financial Controller that this was a good idea to talking ~40 people into spending a weekend in the office away from their friends and family. Challenges were overcome and the participants were divided into 5 teams of 6 each with an employee from the daytime role of account services rep, art director, copywriter, studio artist, office services and finally a single developer. Essentially 5 mini agencies were created and given the following brief:

In 48 hours conceive, build and deploy a 1.0 release of an application. The application must be accompanied by research materials proving its viability, a marketing plan, a sample media plan and comps for collatoral marketing materials.
