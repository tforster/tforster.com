Developed and refined over the past 10-15 years and based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) it is my approach to web site and web app architecture. It allows for 100% separation between browser code and server code and has been successfully applied to all .*p tag languages including .ASP, .PHP, .JSP, .ASPX. allowing web developer/designers maximum creative freedom to work unconstrained in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
